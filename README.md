# Network Programming Integrated Application

This project combines the original standalone assignments (`proje-a.py`, `client-b.py`,
`server-b.py`, `proje-c.py`, and `proje-d.py`) into a single interactive command-line menu.
The integrated launcher imports the functions from those scripts directly so that the
behaviour you observe is produced by the same implementation that was developed for the
individual modules.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or newer.
* No extra dependencies are required because the repository bundles a copy of `ntplib`.

## Running the menu

```bash
python integrated_app.py
```

The program displays a numbered menu. Enter the number of the module you want to run or
`0` to exit. Sub-menus are provided for the Echo Test, Chat, and Error Management modules
so that you can adjust their settings or start/stop background services.

## Module overview

### Machine Information
Uses `print_machine_info()` from `proje-a.py` to show the host name, a best-effort IP
address, and a labelled list of interfaces detected on the machine.

### Echo Test
Reuses `echo_server()` from `server-b.py` and `echo_client()` from `client-b.py`. The
server is launched in a background process and the client runs in the foreground with the
current socket settings. After each run the integrated error log notes that the test was
executed so you can keep track of diagnostics.

### SNTP Time Check
Directly calls `print_time()` from `proje-c.py` to contact `pool.ntp.org`, display the
remote time, compare it to the local clock, and report any communication errors.

### Socket Settings
Provides prompts to update the TCP port, timeout, buffer sizes, and blocking mode that are
passed to both the echo server/client pair and the chat server.

### Chat Module
Wraps the chat utilities defined in `proje-d.py`. You can start or stop the server inside
a background process, or attach a chat client session that stays active until you type
`/quit`. All chat activity continues to be written to `chat_log.txt` by the original
implementation.

### Error Management
Aggregates log messages emitted by the integrated app itself. The log file lives at
`logs/error_log.txt`. Through the submenu you can review the entries or clear the file
before the next experiment.

## Testing and verification

Because every module is interactive, automated tests are not bundled. Run the desired
module from the menu and verify the console output (and any generated log files) to confirm
correct behaviour.

## Repository layout

```
integrated_app.py      # Integrated launcher that orchestrates the original modules
proje-a.py             # Machine information script with print_machine_info()
client-b.py            # Echo client used by the integrated Echo Test menu
server-b.py            # Echo server used by the integrated Echo Test menu
proje-c.py             # SNTP time check helper with print_time()
proje-d.py             # Chat server/client implementation
ntplib.py              # Bundled SNTP client library
chat_log.txt           # Chat transcript generated by proje-d.py
logs/                  # Created automatically; stores error_log.txt
```
